Operation: Elevator Ride to 30
=========================

[Gierael Ortega](https://linkedin.com/in/gieraelortega)'s plan regarding long-term investing in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spring 2020. The "elevator ride to 30" is an analogy I made at the age of 21 for reaching a comfortable state of wealth by the age of 30. Current topics include:

  * Exchange-Traded Funds following Cybersecurity
  * Exchange-Traded Funds following the S&P 500
  * Stocks with dividends and stable growth across different sectors

Exchange-Traded Funds Following Cybersecurity
------------

> “It takes 20 years to build a reputation and few minutes of cyber-incident to ruin it.” - Stephane Nappo

With the ever-growing dependence on technology, cyber-attacks have been expanding in both occurrence and severity (especially with increasing demands in ransomware leading to additional funding for malicious actors). That being said, a long-term investor could potentially leverage this by investing via security-oriented ETFs such as the [First Trust NASDAQ Cybersecurity ETF ($CIBR)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CIBR).


### **My Plan So Far:** Gradually purchase [**$CIBR**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CIBR) (Currently between $30-$32) and hold long-term ###

- **Top 10 Holdings:**

Exchange-Traded Funds following the S&P 500
------------

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a drastic dip in many markets across the globe. Despite this, the S&P 500 has already begun climbing up towards pre-virus levels as the world starts to "reopen". Even if a "second wave" of the virus occurs, we may be near the levels worth investing in ETFs that track the S&P 500 such as the [SPDR S&P 500 ETF TRUST ($SPY)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPY).

### **My Plan So Far:** Gradually purchase [**$SPY**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPY). (Currently between $295-$305) and hold long-term ###

- **FactSet Analysis Rating:** "A" ("A" thru "F")

- **MorningStar Analysis Rating:** 5/5

Relatively Stable Stocks with a Dividend Payout
------------

In addition to investing in ETFs, I plan to diversify my portfolio with the purchase of companies in various sectors with a history of consistent growth and dividends. Since I intend to hold onto my investments for many years (>7 years), capitalizing on these stocks may prove to be lucrative as they continue to recover and grow. Potential prospects include:

 1. [Microsoft ($MSFT)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)
 2. [Realty Income Corp ($O)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/O)
 3. [Coca-Cola Company ($KO)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/KO)
 4. [Johnson & Johnson ($JNJ)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/JNJ)
 5. [AT&T ($T)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/T)
