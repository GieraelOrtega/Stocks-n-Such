Cybersecurity
------------

> “It takes 20 years to build a reputation and few minutes of cyber-incident to ruin it.” - Stephane Nappo

With the ever-growing dependence on technology, cyber-attacks have been expanding in both occurrence and severity (especially with increasing demands in ransomware leading to additional funding for malicious actors). That being said, a long-term investor could potentially leverage this by investing via ETFs such as:

 1. [GLOBAL X CYBERSECURITY ETF ($BUG)](https://snapshot.fidelity.com/fidresearch/snapshot/landing.jhtml#/research?symbol=BUG)
 2. [FIRST TRUST NASDAQ CYBERSECURITY ETF ($CIBR)](https://snapshot.fidelity.com/fidresearch/snapshot/landing.jhtml#/research?symbol=CIBR)
 3. [ETFMG PRIME CYBER SECURITY ETF ($HACK)](https://snapshot.fidelity.com/fidresearch/snapshot/landing.jhtml#/research?symbol=HACK)
 4. [ISHARES CYBERSECURITY AND TECH ETF ($IHAK)](https://snapshot.fidelity.com/fidresearch/snapshot/landing.jhtml#/research?symbol=IHAK)

### **My Plan:** Gradually purchase $CIBR around $29-$31 and hold long-term ###

- **Top 10 Holdings:**

- **FactSet Analysis Rating:** "B" ("A" thru "F")

Developed International Markets
------------

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a drastic dip in all markets across the globe. In particular, [VANGUARD DEVELOPED MARKETS INDEX FUND ($VEA)](https://snapshot.fidelity.com/fidresearch/snapshot/landing.jhtml#/research?symbol=VEA) (which is oriented towards international markets) dipped nearly 60% but is already gradually recovering as the world starts to "reopen". Even if a second wave of COVID hits, now may be an optimal time to start averaging down for the long-term.

### **My Plan:** Gradually purchase $VEA around $35-$37 and hold long-term ###

- **FactSet Analysis Rating:** "A" ("A" thru "F")
![VEA FactSet Analysis Rating](Stocks\VEA\VEA_FactSet_2020-05-24.png)
- **MorningStar Analysis Rating:** 4/5
![VEA MorningStar Analysis Rating](Stocks\VEA\VEA_MorningStar_2020-05-24.png)
- **XTF Analysis Rating:** 9.0/10

Phone Provider(s)
------------

Just like all sectors, COVID-19 has hit phone providers quite hard but they still play an integral part in day-to-day lives and will only continue to grow (hopefully) as 5G continues to roll out. Prospects include:

 1. [AT&T ($T)](https://snapshot.fidelity.com/fidresearch/snapshot/landing.jhtml#/research?symbol=T)
 2. [T-MOBILE US INC ($TMUS)](https://snapshot.fidelity.com/fidresearch/snapshot/landing.jhtml#/research?symbol=TMUS)
 3. [ETFMG PRIME CYBER SECURITY ETF ($VZ)](https://snapshot.fidelity.com/fidresearch/snapshot/landing.jhtml#/research?symbol=VZ)

### **My Plan:** Gradually purchase $T around $28-$31 and hold long-term ###

- **T Dividend Yield:** 6.96%
